# Project-Bamazon
Amazon-like storefront app using MySQL &amp; Node.js.

The inital start of the app displays all the items that are available for sale to the customer.

The app will then prompt customer two messages using Inquirer: What is the ID of the product you want to buy? How many units of the product do you want to buy?

Once the customer's order is placed, stock will be checked. If it is not enough stock, a message "Insufficent quantity!" will be displayed. If there is enough stock, the order will be fulfilled. A messeage "Order was successful!" will be displayed along with total cost of purchase. Also, stock will be update in the SQL database.
